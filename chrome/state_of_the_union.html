            class="clickable" id="55.43"><br/><br/>Web features: Easy discovery. Low friction. Broad reach. Open and decentralized. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="144.2">Our mission is to move the web platform forward.</span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                      id="169.718">Chrome grew to 1 billion active users on mobile last month.</span><span
            class="clickable" id="239.912">We had to go back to first principles to figure out what would make the mobile web awesome.</span><span
            class="clickable" id="251.801"><br/><br/>We believe this mobile experience depends on 4 pillars:</span><span
            class="clickable" id="258.094"><br/>1. Accelerate the experience</span><span class="clickable" id="264.572"><br/>2. Provide an engaging experience</span><span
            class="clickable" id="275.091"><br/>3.Convert visitors into loyal users</span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                id="298.491"><br/>4. Once you have users, retain and reengage them</span><span
            class="clickable" id="319.25"><br/>This required many changes to mobile browsers, but this transformation is now largely complete. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="341.494"><br/><br/>These experiences are known as progressive web apps. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="382.277">Speed is the killer feature. If the page does not respond to your finger press, it is a painful experience. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="435.334"><br/>We recently launched passive event listeners. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="441.511">This lets you give hints to the browser about why you are listening for touch events. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="450.45">Using this API, the browser can do a better job of responding to scroll. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="465.032"><br/><br/>Two phones - comparison. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                           id="493.036">There is a huge difference in responsiveness. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="513.051"><br/><br/>40% of users will abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="522.873">We created <b>AMP - accelerated mobile pages</b> - AMP pages load 4 times faster and use 10x less data. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="558.888">There are over 125 millions AMP documents out there, from 600+ thousand unique domains. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="584.221"><br/><br/>The second pillar is to deepen the engagement by creating polished app experiences. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="603.934"><b>Service workers</b> provide full client side control over fetching and caching. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="619.783"><br/>Jalan Tikus - tech review site in Indonesia example. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="662.531"><br/>Progressive web apps and service workers also enable your app to work well offline. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="668.313">Example - Flipkart. </span><span class="clickable" id="710.318"><br/>Washington Post has created a cool integration as well. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="734">We are making some new investments in the mobile web space. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="736.229">AMP has lived up to its name - on average the pages load in 400ms, which is a huge gain over the traditional mobile web. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="771.25">Users love the speed. </span><span class="clickable" id="802.271"><br/>The question facing publishers today: how can we build engaging and fast experiences that will build relationships with users beyond the search carousel. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="847.388"><br/>We will go to a Washington post story from web search. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="860.6">It loads really fast. </span><span class="clickable" id="860.652">We are using a service worker to install a very small piece of web app behind the scenes. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="878.461">This will upgrade the user to a richer mobile experience. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="905.443">Load times under a second when coming from AMP page. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="917.192">The scrolling experience feels very smooth. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                    id="924.891">We used ideas and principles of AMP to make the pages very light and we added caching ability of service workers to precache pieces of the article before you even get there. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="945.022">Thanks to that, we have brought load times down to 80ms for each article. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="961.88">The precaching also lets us tackle an important issue everyone with a smartphone faces - what happens when you go offline?</span><span
            class="clickable" id="974.372">The DC metro goes in and out of cell service.</span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="1080.186"><b>Third pillar</b>: converting the visitors into loyal users. </span><span
