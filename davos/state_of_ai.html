            class="clickable" id="481">The search industry could go from 1 trillion to 10 trillion dollars. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="497.98">Another consequence of the ability to understand language: the ideal personal assistant. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="634.501"><span class="p3"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="637.761">AI is becoming mainstream. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="649.501">For Baidu it is essentially embedded in every product. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="666.261">We have a platform open to all teams within Baidu. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="704.401">We have now one of the world's largest deep neural nets. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="745.081"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="749.321">We are seeing these technologies move out of the data center and into the world. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="771.501">Its the very widespread nature of devices which can now use these technologies that we are very excited about. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="846.181">The reason: although perception is quite capable, the decisions about what to do is still a good old-fashioned rule based system. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="878.361">Every so often, the rules don't apply - for e.g. cyclist coming down the wrong way. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="893.301">The Google Car gets confused in that situation. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="921.061">A different approach involves not just rules, but also reasons why. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="945.801">To deal with unexpected circumstances, you need to endow the machine with knowledge. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1010.281">This kind of decision making technology will happen in a few years.  </span><span

            class="clickable" id="1047.001"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1058.221">You really need the combination of algorithms and computing capability with a database. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1072.861">On a device, you have constraints on both, but with cloud computing both of those (processing and data) become available.</span><span
            class="clickable" id="1122.801">We are trying to improve the algorithms as well as the capability of the hardware. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="1321.721">AI will help humans in charge even where deep social interaction is required. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1341.761"><span class="t">We have assumed AI being an aid, and not a threat. What is it humans are worried about then?</span></span><span

            class="clickable" id="1441.681">It is given the screen of an Atari game - with no notion of time, speed, death etc. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="1456.861">This is a nice demonstration of generality. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="1507.181"><br/>We know that those techniques don't extend to the wide range of tasks that humans do. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1517.461">But it might only be a small number of breakthroughs between now and general purpose computing. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1532.301">But they are very hard to predict. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="1618.801">We should do the research to take care of it starting now. </span><span
