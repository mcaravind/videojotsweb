            class="clickable" id="123.681">There is a lot of debate about the impact of technology on work. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="161.861"><br/>I would like to introduce two perspectives. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="166.381"><br/>1. Increased productivity: the road to paradise is beginning to look very much the road to hell - The Club of Rome (1997)</span><span
            class="clickable" id="199.501"><br/>2. 1930. John Maynard Keynes. Man will be faced with the question of how to use his leisure time. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="294.92"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="298.42">Two perspectives: AI is already very successful and applied in wide variety of industries. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="310.501">These are what we call narrow AI - they can excel humans in narrow tasks but cannot be general purpose. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="324.84">In narrow AI we have made great progress. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="351.9">The basic premise is that the brain can be understood. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="364.66">We are far away from human level intelligence. It is hard to predict how long it will take. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="385.861">Considering the investments going into it, it is not a question of whether, but when it will happen. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="390.601"><span class="t">So the key factor is prediction forward</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="400.101"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="403.361">One of the things when we beat captcha, there are pattern recognitions. We could also predict the occluded portions of the characters. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="424.821">Being able to make predictions like that can be considered to be a hallmark of intelligence. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="440.821">Being able to mimic that in software is one of the key factors in general AI. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="476.881"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="484.841">A famous quote is "The goal of future is full unemployment so we can all play".</span><span
            class="clickable" id="507.101">But the basic rule of play is : everybody gets a chance. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="530.841">That is the impetus behind those conversations. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="545.061"><span class="t">Mr. Erik, in your book you say there will be few winners and many losers. What is happening in the labor market?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="556.621"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="563.361">It is true that technology is making the pie bigger, overall wealth is getting larger. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="570.581">It is possible some people will come out more ahead than others. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="578.481">Through history, it was mostly a case of a rising tide lifts all boats. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="580.461">In the past 20 years, we are seeing a great decoupling. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="596.961">But median income is lower now than it was late 1990s. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="612.461">This is because technological productivity can be biased towards high skill workers, capital over labor, superstars vs non-superstars. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="633.841">But ultimately it will depend on policies to shift that. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="658.341"><span class="t">Would you say this change is happening exponentially?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="659.341"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="661.841">Technological change is happening exponentially, the institutions are not changing nearly as fast. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="752.881"><span class="p5"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="760.901">The pie is growing bigger, but there is no guarantee everyone will benefit equally due to market alone. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="779.421">We need to develop new systems and policies to help those the market would have left behind. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="795.341">Universal income is one of those ways. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="837.101">There is the leisure industry, the hospitality industry. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="881.841">The question is how to create jobs for the majority of the labor force. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="957.982"><span class="t">Mr. Fujomori, how do you as a corporate executive feel about job security for the workers?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="984.182"><span class="p3"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="992.422">We have about 100 facilities in the world. We have a lot of workers, but we also see machines coming in to raise productivity of the jobs. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1037.242">We are not worried about that, we can always retrain them to do higher value work so we can all prospet. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1045.122">We are worried about disruptive technologies and disruptive business models which will overtake us. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1055.602">The whole company could go down. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                          id="1061.162">So we want to think about competitive strategy. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1079.102">The business model will change dramatically with AI. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1097.102">Its a company's choice, but CEOs of industry has to think about those higher picture stuff. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1108.002"><span class="t">You could get into a vicious cycle. Automating, less workers, less demand, less purchasing power. Isn't it a big dilemma?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1143.162"><span class="p1"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1146.862">It is a concern. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1157.862">The automation companies are also able to create new jobs. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1176.862">For Denmark, this agenda could be a help. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                   id="1193.362"><span
            class="t">When productivity rose, companies made more money, hired more people. Even if people were replaced, new businesses were created. The cycle was not a vicious one. This time do you predict a vicious cycle could occur?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1214.922"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1222.122">I think its a great question, something we need to take seriously. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1225.662">There is no guarantee we will continue as in the past or if we are at a turning point now. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="1239.602">We have to encourage job creation, but there are some disturbing trends. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1258.102">As a whole in the US, there are fewer new companies, entrepreneurship is lower than it was 10-20 years ago. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1292.422"><br/>The old jobs are being automated. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                id="1298.682">Many existing tasks will be automated. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="1307.022">I would like to see us working harder on developing those new jobs. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1334.441"><span class="t">Mr. Pissarides, where do you see areas of growth in the labor market?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1338.281"><span class="p5"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1340.502">No doubt it will be in the service sector. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1356.002">Better skills in human communication will be important. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1393.502">I am in favor of some adjustments in our educational system which will give the labor force these skills. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1418.942">In Europe we are behind the US in this, startups are only now becoming a pattern here. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1465.782"><span class="t">Are the entrepreneurs going to be creating businesses which will absorb the displaced workers?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1485.322"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1489.082">Probably no, because machines will be able to do pretty much everything humans can do. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1499.342">Even better than us. </span><span class="clickable" id="1510.342">Eventually, including communicating with humans. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1547.342">That doesn't mean we won't have meaningful activities. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1549.222">Our definition of what is meaningful has changed over time. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1558.942">Example, a career in TV. </span><span class="clickable" id="1563.022">What will change, is our self worth will be detached from how we much money we make from our work. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1578.522"><span class="t">So we will detach our work and income?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1582.522"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                 id="1584.522">Yes. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1592.522">With basic income, you work because you like work and not because it is a necessity to earn a living. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1605.541"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1609.041">I think it might be useful to distinguish the far future from the near future. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1614.62">I agree with Dileep that eventually machines will be able to do all sorts of things. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1639.221">I don't think that is the immediate challenge right now. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="1649.461">Right now narrow AI is much better at certain tasks - e.g. calculations. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1677.461">The immediate challenge is that certain categories of skills and jobs are becoming automated and therefore the people who make a living on those are having a harder time. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1691.161">Their wages and employment prospects are being pushed down while other types of skills are becoming much more valuable and you are getting superstar incomes at that level. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1702.421">We are seeing this divergence and growing inequality in part because of the technological forces at work. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1718.922">Someday we will reach the Star Trek economy but I dont think we are facing that right now. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1735.342"><span class="t">Can you give us examples</span></span><span
