            class="clickable" id="325.721"><span class="p1"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="328.941">Everybody has understood that it has become an application economy. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="343.021">The way we have built the applications is usually with a waterfall method which takes too long, but we need to move much faster now. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="357.241">Just about everybody has adopted the agile methodology. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="402.041">It is a big cultural change. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="447.941">We get this huge perspective both inside and across the industries of the new developments. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="461.481"><br/>The world has become more complex, more distributed.</span><span
            class="clickable" id="470.401">It is creating a very fast environment. </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="494.901">To be successful, you need not only the sensors in the field, you also need content and applications and analytics and new business models. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="512.001">You need a go to market strategy which is a little different. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="552.501"><br/>To be successful in this economy you have to find partners you can co-collaborate with in order to get the speed and effectiveness you need. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="617.141">The driver to start was two key realizations: close to 1 billions people don't have access to roads. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="648.001">On the other end of the spectrum, half of world's populations already lives in cities and megacities. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="656.761">But the transportation infrastructure is dysfunctional. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="664.861">They call it the internet of flying things. </span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                                    id="669.401"><br/>We looked at the tools available for vehicles to self navigate. When you connect the sensors, it becomes even more interesting. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="698.301">We can move all the traffic off the roads and help people move around more reliably in the city. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="705.341">I think it is a much more natural way to solve the problem. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="724.961"><br/>I see tremendous opportunities not just for us but for everybody who is adopting the mindset of lets build something with the new tools. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="767.301"><span class="p2"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="772.061">People have fallen in love with the word IoT without understanding how it is fundamentally shaking up everything from design to after-market value. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="788.641">10 years ago, you did market research and figured out what customers wanted. You built the product over 1-2 years and shipped it out. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="807.101">You were able to get premium pricing initially, and then it went into a commoditization cycle. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="815.601">The value you created out of design vanished fairly soon. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="822.121">You then sold after sales service.</span><span class="clickable"
                                                                                          id="834.361"><br/>With IoT, you have smart materials combined with smart communication. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="842.421">All the stuff about upgrading and adding features in the product is now driven by software. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="862.121">On the after market side, the biggest opportunity is creating a network of allies who have a symbiotic relationship with you. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="882.981">The iPhone is a classic example. </span><span class="clickable" id="906.721">Very few companies in the world are <i>actually
        thinking this way</i>.</span><span class="clickable" id="909.721">They still believe IoT is about connectivity, about solving logistics networks. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="924.441">If companies don't design and rewire their engineering to believe in this, we will have a connectivity revolution, but we won't see Metcalfe's law actually taking effect. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="957.601"><span class="t">Mike: Talk about some of your customers and what you have been able to achieve in that context</span></span><span

            class="clickable" id="993.881">GE said they want to be one of the top 10 software companies by 2020. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="1052.861"><span class="t">Part of that speed is through partners. Tell us how those partnerships evolve and how that trust has become more fundamental in the relationship.</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1070.421"><span class="p1"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1073.181">Today software is so competitive. </span><span

            class="clickable"
            id="1247.641">The trust with companies has to change - the value is now in the software. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1274.641">When people think about competing in this world, there is more technology at unbelievably low cost which enables those disruptions - the smartphones, the cloud etc. </span><span
            class="clickable"
            id="1291.021">You have to have a partnership community to help monetize your data assets. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1317.161">The incumbents have the channel and the know-how to do all this, they have to pivot and be more inclusive in this digital era. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1334.061"><span class="t">We are moving from a component based thought process to a systemic thought process. One challenge is cybersecurity. Andreas: I worry about your product in that respect. How do you think about this? How does the regulatory framework is shaping your thinking about protecting us from devices?</span></span><span
            class="clickable" id="1394.581"><span class="p4"></span></span><span class="clickable" id="1401.341">I was in a security workshop. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1408.581">The question: is there such a thing as a secure system, and the answer is no. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="1411.981">We have to go through these learnings in a way that is safe. </span><span
