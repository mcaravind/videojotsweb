            class="clickable" id="298.34">Git adds all of the attributes of distributed version control systems. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="309.54">It works in both on-machine as well as a centralized repo model. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="333.602"><br/>Git is one of the version control systems that has been developed in the internet era - it works very well with high latency and constrained bandwidth networks. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="380.742">Git has a very <b>small footprint.</b> </span><span class="clickable"

            class="clickable" id="444.584">Git is built of very small programs that work very well together to give the appearance of a suite of tools. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="456.663">Since the little pieces are still exposed to you, you can compose these with scripts and write your own new git instructions. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="518.723">No admin privileges required. </span><span class="clickable" id="525.763">We have a page that we maintain at GitHub that shows you how to set up Git for different platforms. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="554.164"><br/>I have got it already set up on my machine. </span><span

            class="clickable" id="681.963">This is an absolute inversion of the usual way of thinking about version control. </span><span
            class="clickable" id="719.423">I will create the repository locally, and push it to the network later. In the centralized VCS systems, you need to fetch the repository from the network, and usually only after getting sufficient privileges. </span><span
