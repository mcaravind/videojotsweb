        class="clickable" id="235.365">I think that's not an incremental 4% improvement, its the difference between most of us barely using speech recognition, versus all of us using it all the time and not even thinking about it. </span><span
        class="clickable" id="247.673">The whole world is moving to mobile devices. Humans weren't designed to communicate by poking at things with your fingers. </span><span

        class="clickable" id="484.933">This did not scale. </span><span class="clickable" id="500.953">With GPUs, one of the tricks we develop is called batch dispatch, where instead of serving users one at a time, we might wait a little while until we have 4 users give us their data. </span><span
        class="clickable" id="515.235">Then we take the 4 users data and stack them into a big matrix. </span><span
        class="clickable" id="518.613">With 4 users simultaneously in the GPU we can make very good use of SIMD parallelism. </span><span
        class="clickable" id="528.178">You separate it back out and get the same results as if you had done four different separate computations. </span><span
